TASK 1:

A)8960 meters by 7170 meters

Size is 1792, 1434
Pixel Size = (5.000000000000000,-5.000000000000000)
LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]],

B) 
image resolution = 100 pixels/cm
pixel size = 5 m

distance per pixel= 100m * 5m = 500m

1m=100cm

500m*100cm= 50,000 cm

1 cm on image = 50,000 cm on the ground
(cm's cancel out)

map scale = 1:50,000

TASK 2:

A) gdalinfo independence.dem > output.txt #finds all possible information about independence.dem and prints it to a new file

B) gdalwarp -t_srs NAD83 independence.dem  independence-NAD83.dem #reprojects independence.dem to the NAD83 srs and creates a new file for it

TASK 3:

A) gdaldem hillshade -z 2 independence-NAD83.dem independence-NAD83-shaderel.dem #creates a shaded relief map with independence-NAD83.dem with a -z factor of 2

B) gdal_contour independence-NAD83.dem independence-NAD83-contour.shp -i 10.0 #creates a contour map with independence-NAD83.dem with a contour interval of 10 meters

TASK 4:

A) Approx. 34317 meters by 35921 meters; ogrinfo bldg_clip_dist.shp -al -so #summarizes the information about the shapefile and its layers

B) No because the whitespace is included in the area of the bounding box so you would need a sum of the area of the polygons to get an accurate area of the features

TASK 5:

41; -sql "select COUNT(distinct lu) FROM lulc_clip_dist" lulc_clip_dist.shp #gets the count of the distinct land use categories from the lulc_clip_dist shapefile

TASK 6: 

ogr2ogr -f "KML" %1.kml %1.shp #converts any shapefile name given to a kml file
